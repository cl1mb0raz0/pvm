"""
Scanner-agnostic import pipeline: applies a list of `Detection` records
from one report to the database.

The diffing rules live here, once, whatever the
report's source (manual upload now, scheduled API import later):

- hosts in the report are created or updated; a host is matched by its
  Qualys host ID when the report has one, otherwise by IP + hostname
- a detection already tracked on (host, QID, port, perimeter) updates that
  finding instead of creating a new one
- an open finding of this report's perimeter, on a host covered by this
  report but absent from it, is resolved; findings on other hosts or of
  other perimeters (an external scan never sees what only the internal
  one can) are untouched
- a resolved finding detected again goes to "needs review", unless an
  analyst verified it as not vulnerable (distro patch verification, e.g.
  a backported fix the scanner cannot see from the version banner): then
  it stays resolved and is counted as "verified not vulnerable"
- every host in the report gets the import's tags (never removed here)
- open findings get their due date from the SLA policy (core/sla.py): the
  clock starts at first detection, and again when a finding comes back
- findings reported by a pentest file (`VulnerabilityDefinition.source_name`)
  are never resolved here: a scan did not look for them
