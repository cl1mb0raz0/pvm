"""
"As Of <date>": what the vulnerability situation looked like on a past day.

The question a client asks months later ("how were we on 30 June?") has two
possible answers here, and PVM always says which one it gave:

- **From a snapshot** (`Snapshot` + `FindingState`, written after every
  completed import and every night): the state as it really was, statuses,
  severities, priorities, Ubuntu verdicts and triage included. Exact, but it
  can only cover the days since snapshots started being written.
- **Reconstructed from the scans** already imported, for any earlier date.
  `ScanDetectionEvent` records which scan saw which finding, so "was this
  open then" is answered by the scans themselves: a finding was open on day
  X if a scan up to X had seen it and no later scan up to X, looking at that
  host from that perimeter, failed to see it. Which findings were open is
  exact; everything else (severity, CVSS, EPSS, priority, patch check, team,
  due date) is today's value, and every page that shows a reconstruction
  says so.

Both paths give the same shape: a queryset of findings annotated with
`as_of_*` values, which `state()` turns into what a row should display.
